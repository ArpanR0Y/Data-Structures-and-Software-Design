# Data-Structures-and-Software-Design

This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, covered your skills  and techniques to write “good” software that appropriately represents and organizes data, is easy to maintain, and is of high quality.

As the purpose of most computer programs is to manipulate data, sometimes large quantities of it, the manner in which programs represent and organize data can have an enormous effect on the simplicity and efficiency of the code. In this course, I improved my knowledge about important core data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, trees, and graphs, and understood how to evaluate them and reason about their behavior and efficiency. Most importantly, I learnt how to determine which data structure is the most appropriate for solving the problem at hand, and see how to use the implementations that are part of the Java library.

Along with using the right Data Structure it is important to know how to write high quality code, focusing on the design of the classes that use those data structures and how to maintain existing code. I leant about software design principles such as modularity, functional independence, and abstraction, and applied those concepts towards writing programs that are easy to understand, easy to modify, and easy to test. I also leant how to represent software design using UML 2.0 and use the N-tier architecture to design my program. Finally, I learnt about software refactoring techniques for improving the design of existing code, and see how to improve code efficiency.
